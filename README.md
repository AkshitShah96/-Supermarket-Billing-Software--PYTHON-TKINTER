Problem Definition:
Create a billing software application using Python and Tkinter. The application should allow
users to enter customer details, select products (sanitizer, mask, gloves, etc.) and their quantities,
calculate total prices, apply taxes, and generate a bill. The program should also provide
functionality to search for bills, clear data, and save bills to files.

Concept of Python used in microproject
 Tkinter: GUI library for creating the user interface.
 Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Classes and objects are used to organize the code
into a structured format.
 File Handling: Reading from and writing to files for saving bill information.
 Random Module: Generating random bill numbers.
 Conditional Statements: Used for validation and decision-making processes.
 Looping Constructs: For iterating through products and calculating total prices.
 Functions: Modularizing code into functions for better readability and reusability.
 String Formatting: Formatting strings for displaying bill information.
